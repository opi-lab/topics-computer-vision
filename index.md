# Special Topics in Computer Vision

### Second semester 2019

Andrés Marrugo, PhD       
*Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar*

##  Aims and Scope

This course discusses advanced topics and current research in computer vision. Students are expected to read papers selected from various subareas such as 3D reconstruction, machine vision and inspection, segmentation and grouping, and pattern recognition. Approaches for learning from image data will be covered and include topics from convolutional neural networks, sparse and redundant representations, and others. The course will be a mix of lecture, student presentation and discussion.

### Course Goals: 
- Gaining research experience in computer vision.
- Get exposed to a variety of topics and become familiar with state-of-the-art techniques. 
- Learn to read and evaluate other people’s work.
- Get hands dirty on a research project.


<!-- This semester course is an introduction to computer vision. It is aimed at graduate students in the Faculty of Engineering. We will focus on the practical and theoretical aspects of techniques in computer vision. -->

<!-- At the end of the lectures, one would be able to:

- Have clear idea of challenges in computer vision due to increasing use in mobile applications.
- Understand many different computer vision algorithms and approaches.
- Implement computer vision algorithms for mid-level vision tasks. -->
